## Project description

Brain Games is a collection of five mini-games designed to challenge the user's mental agility. Each game begins with a greeting, personalized with the user's name, and consists of three rounds.

## Games

- **Brain Even**: The game asks the user to determine if a number is even.
- **Brain Calc**: The game presents an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication) on two numbers and asks the user to calculate the result.
- **Brain GCD**: The game asks the user to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- **Brain Progression**: The game presents an arithmetic progression with one number missing and asks the user to identify the missing number.
- **Brain Prime**: The game asks the user to determine if a number is prime.
